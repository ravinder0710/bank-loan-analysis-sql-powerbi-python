## 📌 Executive Summary
In retail and commercial banking, assessing lending portfolios, managing liquidity, and mitigating credit default risk are foundational to institutional solvency. A mismatch between disbursement rates and debt collections can quickly lead to systemic liquidity contraction.
This project delivers an enterprise **Bank Loan Analytics & Portfolio Risk System** built upon a rigorous **"SQL-First as the Source of Truth"** methodology. Analyzing **38,576 loan transactions across FY2021 totaling $435.76M in funded capital and $473.07M in cash collections**, the project establishes a robust data reconciliation pipeline across **MySQL (37 production queries with CTEs, conditional logic, and window functions)**, **Python exploratory scripts (statistical distributions & Plotly treemaps)**, and an interactive **Power BI 2-Page Executive Dashboard Suite (Summary View & Overview Dimensional Slice-and-Dice)**.

💻 SQL Engineering & Analytical Implementation

  
1. Robust Date Parsing Workaround (Handling Text Timestamps)

  

The raw dataset stores issue_date as TEXT in DD-MM-YYYY format (e.g. "12-12-2021"). Native MySQL functions like MONTH() silently fail on raw text strings without error. To prevent catastrophic silent bugs, all temporal queries use:


  
sql
STR_TO_DATE(issue_date, '%d-%m-%Y')

  
2. Multi-Period MoM CTE Pattern

  
sql
WITH mtd AS (
    SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS MTD
    FROM financial_loan
    WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(issue_date, '%d-%m-%Y')) = 12
      AND YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(issue_date, '%d-%m-%Y')) = 2021
),
pmtd AS (
    SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS PMTD
    FROM financial_loan
    WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(issue_date, '%d-%m-%Y')) = 11
      AND YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(issue_date, '%d-%m-%Y')) = 2021
)
SELECT 
    CONCAT(ROUND((MTD - PMTD) / PMTD * 100, 2), '%') AS MoM_Funded_Amount
FROM mtd
CROSS JOIN pmtd;
-- Result: 13.04% Month-over-Month Capital Expansion

  
3. Conditional Loan Health Segmentation

  
sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status IN ('Fully Paid', 'Current') THEN id END) AS Good_Loan_Applications,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Charged Off' THEN id END) AS Bad_Loan_Applications,
        COUNT(id) AS Total_Applications
    FROM financial_loan
)
SELECT 
    CONCAT(ROUND((Good_Loan_Applications / Total_Applications) * 100, 2), '%') AS Good_Loan_Percentage,
    CONCAT(ROUND((Bad_Loan_Applications / Total_Applications) * 100, 2), '%') AS Bad_Loan_Percentage
FROM CTE;
-- Result: 86.18% Good vs 13.82% Bad Loans

Product Duration Dominance: 36-month loan terms comprise 73.2% of applications (28,237 loans), indicating borrower preference for rapid debt clearance over lower monthly payments.

  
Purpose Concentration: Debt Consolidation represents the overwhelming majority of funding, followed by Credit Card refinancing. Borrowers are primarily leveraging bank credit to restructure existing liabilities.

  
Regional Exposure: California (CA), New York (NY), and Texas (TX) constitute the largest geographic concentrations of funded capital.

  

  

  
🎯 Strategic Banking Recommendations

  

  
Tighten Credit Tiering for High DTI & Low Grade Borrowers: Restrict unsecured lending limits for grades E, F, and G where charge-off rates spike.

  
Implement Early Warning Collection Signals: Track repayment lag at Day 30 and Day 60 to initiate restructuring before loans reach default status.

  
Capitalize on 36-Month Loan Term Velocity: Create tailored lower-rate incentives for short-duration borrowers who consistently demonstrate lower delinquency rates.
